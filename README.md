This repository contains a complete Mini Lab Report developed using LaTeX in Overleaf, created as a comprehensive practice project for beginners learning LaTeX fundamentals. The project demonstrates how to build a properly structured academic document starting from a blank LaTeX project, including the creation of a title page, page layout customization, and organized sections and subsections. It covers essential LaTeX concepts such as writing formatted text, creating itemized lists, designing tables with borders, captions, and labels, inserting and referencing figures using the graphicx package, and typesetting mathematical equations including formulas, integrals, and matrices with the help of the amsmath package. In addition, the project introduces proper academic referencing by using a separate BibTeX (.bib) file to manage sources, citing them within the text using natbib, and generating a bibliography automatically. This lab report is intended to simulate a real university lab submission and can be completed within a short time frame while reinforcing all core LaTeX skills. It is ideal for undergraduate students, first-time LaTeX users, and anyone looking to understand how professional academic documents are prepared using LaTeX and Overleaf.

If you want, I can also:

Make this paragraph more technical or more beginner-friendly

Shorten it for a GitHub “About” section

Rewrite it according to university lab manual style

Add keywords and tags for better GitHub visibility

Just tell me 😊
